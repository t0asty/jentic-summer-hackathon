# Track 08 – Chrome Extension for API Discovery

**Goal**: Build a browser extension that automatically discovers and generates OpenAPI specifications from any website by analyzing network traffic and API calls.

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate  
**Perfect for**: Web developers interested in browser APIs, reverse engineering, and making hidden APIs discoverable

## What You'll Build

A Chrome extension that:
- **Monitors network requests** on any website
- **Identifies API patterns** from HTTP traffic
- **Generates OpenAPI specifications** automatically
- **Exports results** for use with Jentic and other tools
- **Provides a simple UI** for users to trigger discovery

**Your deliverable**: A working Chrome extension that users can install and use to discover APIs on any website with a single click.

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and web APIs
- Familiarity with Chrome extension development (helpful but not required)
- Understanding of HTTP requests and responses
- Basic knowledge of JSON and API structures

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Understanding of REST APIs and HTTP methods
- Basic familiarity with OpenAPI/Swagger format
- Knowledge of browser developer tools
- No advanced programming experience required

## The Problem

Many websites use **undocumented APIs** that could be useful:
- **Internal APIs** that power web applications
- **Mobile APIs** that aren't publicly documented  
- **AJAX endpoints** that handle dynamic content
- **Search and filtering APIs** that process user queries
- **Data APIs** that fetch content without page refreshes

**Your extension will make these APIs discoverable and usable.**

## Getting Started (30 minutes)

### 1. Project Setup
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir chrome-api-discovery
cd chrome-api-discovery

# Create basic extension structure
mkdir -p src/
mkdir -p icons/
mkdir -p popup/
mkdir -p background/
mkdir -p content/
```

### 2. Understanding Chrome Extension Architecture
Your extension will have these components:

**Manifest v3 Structure**:
- **Background script** - Monitors network requests
- **Content script** - Interacts with web pages
- **Popup UI** - User interface for starting discovery
- **Storage** - Saves discovered API patterns

### 3. Test Your Development Setup
```bash
# Start with a basic extension
# Load extension in Chrome:
# 1. Open chrome://extensions/
# 2. Enable "Developer mode"
# 3. Click "Load unpacked" and select your project folder
```

## Your Implementation Tasks
