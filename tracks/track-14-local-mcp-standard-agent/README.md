# Track 14 – Local MCP Support in Standard Agent

**Goal**: Enable Standard Agent to work with local development environments through MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, supporting filesystem operations, browser automation, and local APIs.

**Time Estimate**: 6-10 hours (full weekend)  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Perfect for**: Developers familiar with Standard Agent architecture, local development tooling, and system integration

## What You'll Build

**MCP Integration for Standard Agent** that enables:
- **Filesystem Operations**: Read, write, and manipulate local files
- **Browser Automation**: Control browsers with Playwright/Puppeteer
- **Local API Access**: Connect to development servers and local services
- **Development Tool Integration**: Git operations, code analysis, testing
- **System Operations**: Execute local commands and scripts

**Your deliverable**: A Standard Agent that can work seamlessly with local development environments, bridging AI reasoning with local system capabilities.

## Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### What is MCP?
MCP is a protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local resources and tools through a standardized interface. It provides:

- **Secure Access**: Controlled interaction with local systems
- **Standardized Protocol**: Consistent interface across different tools
- **Resource Management**: Efficient handling of local resources
- **Permission System**: Fine-grained control over what agents can access

### MCP Server Types
- **Filesystem MCP**: File and directory operations
- **Browser MCP**: Web automation and scraping
- **Git MCP**: Version control operations
- **Database MCP**: Local database access
- **Shell MCP**: Command line operations
- **Development MCP**: IDE and development tool integration

## Current Standard Agent Architecture

### Existing Tool Integration
```python
# Current Standard Agent structure
class StandardAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools, memory, reasoner):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools  # Currently JenticClient (remote APIs)
        self.memory = memory
        self.reasoner = reasoner
    
    def solve(self, goal: str) -> str:
        return self.reasoner.reason(goal, self.tools, self.memory)

# Current JenticClient provides remote API access
class JenticClient(JustInTimeToolingBase):
    def get_tools(self, query: str) -> List[Tool]:
        # Returns remote API tools from Jentic platform
        pass
```

### Extension Strategy
Your implementation will extend the tool system to include local MCP capabilities:

```python
class HybridToolProvider(JustInTimeToolingBase):
    def __init__(self, jentic_client, mcp_client):
        self.jentic_client = jentic_client  # Remote APIs
        self.mcp_client = mcp_client        # Local MCP tools
    
    def get_tools(self, query: str) -> List[Tool]:
        # TODO: Combine remote and local tools intelligently
        remote_tools = self.jentic_client.get_tools(query)
        local_tools = self.mcp_client.get_local_tools(query)
        return self.merge_and_prioritize(remote_tools, local_tools)
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: MCP Client Foundation (3-4 hours)

```python
class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self, mcp_servers: List[MCPServer]):
        self.servers = mcp_servers
        self.active_connections = {}
    
    def connect_to_servers(self):
        # TODO: Establish connections to MCP servers
        # Handle authentication and capability discovery
        pass
    
    def discover_capabilities(self, server: MCPServer) -> List[Capability]:
        # TODO: Query MCP server for available tools and resources

```

### Phase 2: Standard Agent Integration (2-3 hours)

#### Tool Discovery and Selection
```python
class LocalToolSelector:
    def should_use_local_tool(self, query: str, available_tools: List[Tool]) -> bool:
        # TODO: Decide when to prefer local vs remote tools
        # Consider factors like:

        pass
    
    def rank_tool_options(self, query: str, local_tools: List[Tool], remote_tools: List[Tool]) -> List[Tool]:
        # TODO: Intelligently rank and combine tool options
        pass
```

#### Security and Permissions
```python
class MCPSecurityManager:
    def __init__(self, permission_config: Dict):
        self.permissions = permission_config
    
    def check_file_permission(self, operation: str, file_path: str) -> bool:
        # TODO: Check if operation is allowed on file/directory
        # Implement safeguards against dangerous operations
        pass
    
    def validate_command(self, command: str) -> bool:
        # TODO: Validate shell commands for safety
        # Block dangerous operations, validate arguments
        pass
    
    def get_allowed_directories(self) -> List[str]:
        # TODO: Return list of directories agent can access
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Advanced MCP Features (2-3 hours)

#### Development Environment Integration
```python
class DevEnvironmentMCPTools:
    def run_tests(self, test_path: str = None) -> TestResults:
        # TODO: Execute test suites and return results
        pass
    
    def analyze_code(self, file_path: str) -> CodeAnalysis:
        # TODO: Run static analysis, linting, type checking
        pass
    
    def git_operations(self, operation: str, **kwargs) -> GitResult:
        # TODO: Git status, diff, commit, branch operations
        pass
    
    def start_dev_server(self, config: DevServerConfig) -> ServerInfo:
        # TODO: Start local development servers
        pass
    
    def query_local_api(self, endpoint: str, method: str = "GET", **kwargs) -> APIResponse:
        # TODO: Make requests to local development APIs
        pass
```

#### System Monitoring and Management
```python
class SystemMCPTools:
    def get_system_info(self) -> SystemInfo:
        # TODO: Get CPU, memory, disk usage
        pass
    
    def list_processes(self, filter_pattern: str = None) -> List[ProcessInfo]:
        # TODO: List running processes
        pass
    
    def monitor_file_changes(self, directory: str) -> FileChangeStream:
        # TODO: Watch for file system changes
        pass
    
    def check_port_availability(self, port: int) -> bool:
        # TODO: Check if network port is available
        pass
```

## Use Case Examples

### Local Development Workflow
```python
# Example: Agent helps with web development
goal = """
I'm building a React app. Please:
1. Check the current project structure
2. Run the tests to see what's failing
3. Fix any linting issues you find
4. Start the development server
5. Take a screenshot of the app
"""

# Agent would use MCP tools to:
# - Read package.json and project files
# - Execute npm test
# - Run eslint and fix issues
# - Start npm start
# - Use browser automation for screenshot
```

### Code Analysis and Improvement
```python
goal = """
Analyze my Python project for code quality:
1. Check all .py files for style issues
2. Run type checking with mypy
3. Identify potential security issues
4. Suggest improvements and create a report
"""

# Agent uses MCP tools for:
# - File system operations to find Python files
# - Execute flake8, black, mypy
# - Run security scanners like bandit
# - Generate and save improvement report
```

### Automated Testing and CI
```python
goal = """
Prepare this project for deployment:
1. Run full test suite
2. Check test coverage
3. Build the project
4. Run security scans
5. Generate deployment report
"""
```

## Integration Patterns

### Hybrid Tool Usage
```python
class HybridWorkflowExample:
    def research_and_implement(self, feature_request: str):
        # 1. Use remote APIs to research best practices
        research = self.jentic_tools.search_web(f"best practices for {feature_request}")
        
        # 2. Use local MCP to analyze current codebase
        current_code = self.mcp_tools.analyze_project_structure()
        
        # 3. Use LLM to plan implementation
        plan = self.llm.plan_implementation(research, current_code, feature_request)
        
        # 4. Use local MCP to implement changes
        self.mcp_tools.implement_code_changes(plan)
        
        # 5. Use local MCP to test changes
        test_results = self.mcp_tools.run_tests()
        
        return test_results
```

### Privacy-Aware Tool Selection
```python
def select_appropriate_tool(self, task_description: str, data_sensitivity: str):
    if data_sensitivity == "private":
        # Use local MCP tools for sensitive data
        return self.mcp_tools.get_local_tools(task_description)
    elif data_sensitivity == "public":
        # Use remote APIs for public data processing
        return self.jentic_tools.get_tools(task_description)
    else:
        # Use hybrid approach
        return self.combine_tools(task_description)
```

## Security Considerations

### Permission Management
```yaml
# Example MCP permission configuration
mcp_permissions:
  filesystem:
    allowed_directories:
      - "./src/"
      - "./tests/"
      - "./docs/"
    blocked_directories:
      - "/etc/"
      - "/usr/"
      - "~/.ssh/"
    allowed_extensions:
      - ".py"
      - ".js"
      - ".md"
      - ".json"
      - ".yaml"
    max_file_size: "10MB"
  
  commands:
    allowed_commands:
      - "npm test"
      - "pytest"
      - "git status"
      - "git diff"
    blocked_commands:
      - "rm -rf"
      - "sudo"
      - "chmod 777"
  
  network:
    allowed_ports:
      - 3000-3999  # Development servers
      - 8000-8999  # Local APIs
    blocked_domains:
      - "production-api.com"
```

### Data Protection
- **Sandbox Operations**: Isolate MCP operations in controlled environments
- **Audit Logging**: Track all local operations for security review
- **Permission Escalation**: Require explicit approval for sensitive operations
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive files before processing

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios
```python
# Test local file operations
def test_filesystem_operations():
    agent = StandardAgent(mcp_tools=FilesystemMCPTools())
    result = agent.solve("Create a summary of all Python files in this project")
    # Verify agent can read files and generate summaries

# Test browser automation
def test_browser_integration():
    agent = StandardAgent(mcp_tools=BrowserMCPTools())
    result = agent.solve("Take a screenshot of localhost:3000 after it loads")
    # Verify browser automation works correctly

# Test development workflow
def test_dev_workflow():
    agent = StandardAgent(hybrid_tools=HybridToolProvider())
    result = agent.solve("Check code quality and suggest improvements")
    # Verify agent can use both local and remote tools
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Tool Selection Speed**: How quickly can agent choose appropriate tools?
- **Operation Latency**: Local vs remote tool execution times
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU impact of MCP operations
- **Security Overhead**: Performance cost of permission checking
