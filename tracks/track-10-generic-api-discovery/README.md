# Track 10 – Generic API Discovery (Open-Ended)

**Goal**: "There are websites that don't have APIs or documented APIs. We would like to have their APIs. You figure it out."

**Time Estimate**: 3-8 hours (varies widely by approach)  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Advanced (depends on chosen method)  
**Perfect for**: Creative problem solvers, reverse engineers, and developers who like open-ended challenges

## What You'll Build

**Your choice!** This track is intentionally open-ended. You can:
- **Web scrape** and create API specifications from scraped patterns
- **Reverse engineer** mobile apps to find hidden API endpoints
- **Manually document** APIs by observing network traffic
- **Build custom tooling** for automated API discovery
- **Create hybrid approaches** combining multiple techniques
- **Focus on specific domains** (e-commerce, news, social media)

**Your deliverable**: Working OpenAPI specifications for previously undocumented APIs, plus documentation of your discovery methodology.

## The Challenge

Many valuable services have **no public APIs**:
- Local business directories
- Government services portals
- Legacy enterprise systems
- Mobile-only applications
- Single-page applications with hidden endpoints
- Real estate platforms
- Restaurant/booking systems

**Your mission**: Make the invisible visible. Document these hidden APIs so agents and developers can use them.

## Possible Approaches

### Method 1: Web Scraping + API Inference
- Analyze website structure and data patterns
- Build scrapers that mimic API responses
- Create OpenAPI specs that describe the scraped data
- **Tools**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Playwright

### Method 2: Network Traffic Analysis
- Monitor browser network requests while using websites
- Identify AJAX/fetch patterns that aren't documented
- Reverse engineer request/response formats
- **Tools**: Browser DevTools, mitmproxy, Wireshark

### Method 3: Mobile App Reverse Engineering
- Decompile mobile apps to find API endpoints
- Analyze network requests from mobile applications
- Document mobile-specific APIs
- **Tools**: mitmproxy, Frida, Android/iOS debugging tools

### Method 4: Manual API Documentation
- Use websites extensively and document all network calls
- Create comprehensive API documentation from observation
- Focus on completeness and accuracy
- **Tools**: Postman, Insomnia, curl, manual testing

### Method 5: Automated Discovery Tools
- Build tools that automatically discover API patterns
- Create intelligent crawlers that find undocumented endpoints
- Use AI to predict likely API structures
- **Tools**: Custom scripts, LLMs, pattern recognition

### Method 6: Hybrid Approaches
- Combine multiple methods for comprehensive coverage
- Use automation where possible, manual verification where needed
- Focus on specific industry verticals

## Target Ideas

### High-Value Targets
- **Real Estate Sites**: Property search, listing details, market data
- **Job Boards**: Job search, company information, salary data
- **Local Business**: Restaurant menus, business hours, reviews
- **Government**: Public records, permits, regulatory data
- **E-commerce**: Product catalogs, pricing, inventory

### Technical Targets
- **SPA Applications**: React/Vue apps with hidden API calls
- **Mobile Web**: Mobile-optimized sites with different endpoints
- **Legacy Systems**: Older websites with form-based interactions
- **Geo-specific**: Location-based services and directories

## Implementation Guidelines

### Choose Your Focus
1. **Pick a domain** you're interested in or familiar with
2. **Select 1-3 websites** to focus on (don't spread too thin)
3. **Choose your methodology** based on your skills and tools
4. **Set realistic scope** - even 1 well-documented API is valuable

### Discovery Process
1. **Reconnaissance**: Explore the website/service thoroughly
2. **Pattern Identification**: Look for data that could be API-driven
3. **Technical Analysis**: Use your chosen tools to find endpoints
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive OpenAPI specifications
5. **Validation**: Test your documented APIs work correctly

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: APIs you document should work as described
- **Completeness**: Cover the main functionality of the service
- **Clarity**: Provide clear descriptions and examples
- **Reproducibility**: Others should be able to verify your findings

## Deliverables

### Minimum Viable Product
- [ ] **1 working OpenAPI specification** for an undocumented API
- [ ] **Discovery methodology** documentation explaining your approach
- [ ] **Validation evidence** showing the API works (screenshots, tests)
- [ ] **Usage examples** demonstrating key functionality

### Enhanced Submission
- [ ] **Multiple API specifications** (2-5 different services)
- [ ] **Automated tooling** for ongoing discovery or monitoring
- [ ] **Comprehensive documentation** of discovery process
- [ ] **Industry analysis** comparing APIs across similar services

### Professional Quality
- [ ] **Production-ready specs** suitable for agent integration
- [ ] **Discovery framework** that others can use
- [ ] **Legal compliance analysis** for discovered APIs
- [ ] **Contribution to Jentic Public APIs** repository

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

### Best Practices
- **Respect robots.txt** and rate limits
- **Don't overload servers** with excessive requests
- **Consider terms of service** - avoid violating ToS
- **Focus on public data** available through normal website usage
- **Document responsibly** - don't expose private or sensitive endpoints

### Legal Guidelines
- Only document APIs for **publicly accessible information**
- Avoid accessing **user-specific or private data**
- Don't document APIs that require **authentication bypass**
- Consider **fair use** principles in your documentation
- When in doubt, **ask for permission** from site owners

## Technical Tips

### Web Scraping
- Use **respectful crawling** practices (delays, user agents)
- Handle **dynamic content** with headless browsers
- **Cache responses** to avoid repeated requests
- **Structure data consistently** for API specification generation

### Network Analysis
- Use **private browsing** to avoid personalized responses
- **Clear browser state** between sessions for consistent results
- **Document authentication flows** if publicly available
- **Capture multiple examples** of requests/responses

### Reverse Engineering
- Focus on **publicly documented functionality**
- Use **official mobile apps** rather than modifying them
- **Document observed behavior** rather than internal implementation
- **Verify findings** through multiple sources

## Success Examples

### Good Discoveries
- Restaurant website with hidden menu/hours API
- Local government site with permit search functionality
- Real estate platform with property search endpoints
- News site with article search and categorization

### Documentation Quality
- Clear operation descriptions and parameters
- Realistic example requests and responses
- Proper error handling documentation
- Authentication requirements clearly stated

## Real-World Impact

This track addresses critical needs:
- **API Accessibility**: Makes hidden functionality discoverable
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduces need for screen scraping
- **Agent Capabilities**: Expands what AI agents can access
- **Data Liberation**: Makes public data more accessible through structured APIs

Remember: **Be creative, be ethical, be thorough**. The goal is to expand the universe of accessible APIs while respecting the rights and resources of service providers. Every API you discover and properly document makes the ecosystem more powerful for everyone!
